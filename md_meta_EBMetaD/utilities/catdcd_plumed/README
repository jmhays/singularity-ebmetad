catdcd/plumed integrated

Compiling:

It requires to have vmd installed on the machine 

1)in this dir make a new directory called plumed_links:

mkdir plumed_links

2) in plumed_links link (or copy) all the source file in the 
common_files plumed directory

cd plumed_links
ln -s my_path_to_common_dir/*.c  
ln -s my_path_to_common_dir/*.h  

3) set the correct paths for the molfile plugins :
to do this you should download the vmd source version 
and compile only the plugins.(enter the plugins directory and 
run build.csh) When you are done you should have several useful 
files which are 
libmolfile_plugin.h
molfile_plugin.h
libmolfile_plugin.so
you have to set the coorrect paths to all iof these elements in the Makefile
There you should adapt everything according to its architecture and compiler.
Hope it is all


HOW TO USE IT:
you use simply with:

catdcd_plumed -s diala_namd.pdb -plumed metadyn.cfg -mass_from_beta outcoord_1.dcd

but remember that you always should provide a structure file and tell plumed where to take
the mass (mandatory) with -mass_from_beta  or -mass_from_occ options
